         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am Reſolved to leave nothing unattempted on My Part, which may contribute to the Peace and Proſperity of this Nation; And finding My Preſence in <hi>Ireland</hi> will be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the more ſpeedy Reducing of that Kingdom, I continue My Reſolution of going thither as ſoon as may be; And I have now Called you together for your Aſſiſtance, to Enable Me to Proſecute the War with Speed and Vigour: In which I Aſſure My Self of your cheerful Concurrence, being a Work ſo neceſſary for your own Safeties.</p>
            <p>In Order to this, I deſire you will forthwith make a Settlement of the Revenue; and I cannot doubt, but you will therein have as much Regard for the Honour and Dignity of the Monarchy in My Hands, as has been lately ſhewed to others: And I have ſo great a Confidence in you, That if no Quicker on more Convenient way can be found for the Raiſing of Ready Money (without which the Service cannot be performed) I ſhall be very well Content, for the preſent, to have it made ſuch a Fond of Credit as may be Uſeful to your ſelves as well as Me, in this Conjuncture, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt Apprehenſions, but that you will provide for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off all ſuch Anticipations as it ſhall happen to fall under.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently known how Earneſtly I have Endeavoured to Extinguiſh (or at leaſt Compoſe) all Differences amongſt My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to that End, how often I have Recommended an Act of Indemnity to the laſt Parliament; But ſince that Part of it which related to the Preventing of Private Suits is already Enacted, and becauſe Debates of that Nature, muſt take up more of your Time
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47200:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 42 -->then can now be ſpared from the Diſpatch of thoſe other Things, which are abſolutely neceſſary for Our Common Safety, I intend to ſend you an Act of Grace, with Exceptions of ſome few Perſons only, but ſuch as may be ſufficient to ſhew My great Diſlike of their Crimes, and at the ſame time My Readineſs to extend Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all My other Subjects, who will thereby ſee, that they can Recommend themſelves to Me by no other Methods then what the Laws Preſcribe, which ſhall always be the only Rules of My Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>A further Reaſon which induceth Me to ſend you this Act at this time, is, Becauſe I am deſirous to leave no Colour of Excuſe to any of My subjects for the Raiſing of Diſturbances in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and eſpecially in the time of My Abſence: And I ſay this, both to Inform you, and to let ſome Ill Affected Men ſee, That I am not unacquainted how buſie they are in their preſent Endeavours to Alter it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Encouragements which I find they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, one of the Ways by which they hope to Compaſs their Deſigns, is, By creating Differences and Diſagreements in your Counſels, which I hope you will be very Careful to Prevent; For be aſſured, That Our greateſt Enemies can have no better Inſtruments for their Purpoſes, then thoſe who ſhall any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Diſturb or Delay your Speedy and Unanimous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon theſe neceſſary Matters.</p>
            <p>I muſt Recommend alſo to your Conſideration an Union with <hi>Scotland;</hi> I do not mean it ſhould now be entred upon, but they having Propoſed this to Me ſome time ſince, and the Parliament there having Nominated Commiſſioners for that purpoſe, I ſhould be glad that Commiſſioners might alſo be Nominated here to Treat with them, and to ſee if ſuch Terms could be Agreed on, as might be for the Benefit of both Nations, ſo as to be ready to be Preſented to you in ſome future Seſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thought it moſt convenient to leave the Adminiſtration of the Government in the Hands of the QUEEN during My Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; And if it ſhall be judg'd neceſſary to have an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the better Confirmation of it to Her, I Deſire you will let ſuch an one be prepared to be Preſented to Me.</p>
            <p>I have this only to add, That the Seaſon of the Year, and My Journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi> will admit but of a very ſhort Seſſion; ſo that I muſt Recommend to you the making ſuch Diſpatch, that We may not be Engaged in Debates when Our Enemies ſhall be in the Field: for the Succeſs of the War, and the more Thrifty Management of it, will both principally depend upon your ſpeedy Reſolutions. And I hope it will not be long before We ſhall Meet again, to perfect what the Time will not now allow to be done.</p>
